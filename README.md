## Project-Name-Gold-Price-Prediction-Using-Time-Series-Forecasting ##
Gold price prediction using historical time series data (2013–2023) with ARIMA and improved Bidirectional LSTM models.
This project predicts future gold prices using historical data from 2013 to 2023. The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed for analysis. Two models are implemented: ARIMA as a statistical baseline and an improved Bidirectional LSTM neural network to capture non-linear patterns and long-term dependencies. The LSTM model is trained with a train-test split, dropout regularization, and early stopping to prevent overfitting. Model performance is evaluated using RMSE on unseen test data, and a 30-day future forecast is generated. The project demonstrates practical application of time series forecasting and deep learning in financial prediction.
